- Rebase with patovala repo master
- Create the pull request. Make sure your branch is rebased and travis is passing.

### Rebase with patovala repo master

- Add remote patovala's repo ( you need to add the remote one)
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/patovala/twittexpress.git`
- Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches
`git fetch upstream`
- Rebase your branch against patovala's branch
`git rebase upstream/master`
